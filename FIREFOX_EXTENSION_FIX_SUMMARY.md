# Firefox Extension Connection Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The Native Host was successfully connecting to the backend, but all requests to `/api/argosa/data/native/status` and `/api/argosa/data/native/message` were taking 10+ seconds and returning 400 errors.

## Root Causes Found

1. **Request Body Parsing Issue**: The middleware in `main.py` was consuming the request body for logging, which prevented FastAPI from parsing it later with `Body(...)`.

2. **No Auto-Reload**: The backend server was running without the `--reload` flag, so code changes weren't taking effect.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Request Body Handling
Changed from using `Body(...)` dependency to using `Request` object directly:

```python
# Before:
async def update_native_status(status: Dict[str, Any] = Body(...)):

# After:
async def update_native_status(request: Request):
    status = await request.json()
```

### 2. Fixed Middleware Body Logging
Removed body logging from middleware to prevent consuming the request stream:

```python
# Removed problematic body logging that was consuming the request
```

### 3. Added Auto-Reload to Backend
Updated `One.bat` to include `--reload` flag:

```batch
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --log-level debug --timeout-keep-alive 75 --reload
```

## Current Status

The fixes have been applied to the code, but the backend server needs to be restarted for them to take effect.

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the backend** by running `One.bat` again
2. The Native Host should now be able to communicate with the backend without timeouts
3. The Firefox extension should show as "connected" in the UI

## Test Commands

After restarting, you can test the fix with:

```bash
# Test from WSL
curl -X POST http://172.31.224.1:8000/api/argosa/data/native/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "connected", "extension_ready": true}' \
  -m 2 -w "\nTime: %{time_total}s\n"
```

Expected result: Response within 0.1 seconds with status 200.
